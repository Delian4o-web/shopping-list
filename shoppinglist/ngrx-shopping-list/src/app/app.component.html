<!-- 
1... The AddItemAction is fired with the payload of newShoppingItem.
2... Our shoppingReducer sees the new action and filters by action.type.
3... As the action.type is [SHOPPING] Add Item the newShoppingItem is added to the end of our array: [...state, action.payload],
4... The shopping slice of state is updated and as we're subscribed to changes with the async pipe our UI updates.
